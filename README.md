# Lending_Club_Analysis

Analyze over 3 million loan requests to find out what makes a successful request.

#Data

Over 3 million loan requests in the year 2015. All data is obtained from Lending Club a peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. Features include:
* Amount Requested
* Reason for Request
* Debt-To-Income Ratio
* Employment Length
* Location of Request
* Date of Request


#Methodology

The main goal was to analyze what factors lead to a successful loan request. Since, we wanted to have a combination of interpretability and prediction we decided logistic regression was appropriate for this analysis. Our response variable was whether or not the request was successful, 1=yes no=0, and the features listed above the predictors.
